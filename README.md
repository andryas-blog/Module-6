# Module-6

Problem 1 was a challenge for me as I needed to get creative with incorporating the current time into the provided code. Problem 4 was similar as I needed to get creative with using the feet and inches input within my code. The other problems were straight forward. Overall, the assignments were straight forward. I request any feedback to help me improve this specific code for this assignment as I did not feel 100% certain I completed it correctly. Thank you! :)
